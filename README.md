# My-true-geatest-fear
## it is hard for me to think of just one thing I fear so that's the reason why I made the joke one before

although if I were to name just a few they would be 

> my loved ones dieing

just the thought of those I care about dieng is not something I like I would rather none of those people die during my life time.

> not being good enough

the idea that no matter how hard I try I will never be good I get that a lot when I go into something thinking that I know somethings 

expeacting something simular to the dunning kruger effect to happen to me but in the end it is nothing like that happens because with that effect

people still know a bit but I don't understand anything people are talking about and I find that people think I do know

so when people ask for my help be it that they do not know or that they think spliting things up will help with time I agree to help because I always

want to help others but than in the end I don't even contribute anything in the end
